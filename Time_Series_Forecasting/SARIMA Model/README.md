# SARIMA Process for Time Series Analysis

## Overview
The **SARIMA Process for Time Series Analysis** project is a Python-based implementation focused on understanding and forecasting trends in time series data. By leveraging the Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, the project demonstrates how a combination of past values, differencing, forecast errors, and seasonality can be used to predict future values, providing a comprehensive approach to time series forecasting for seasonal data.

The project showcases techniques in data preprocessing, time series analysis, and the practical application of SARIMA models to derive meaningful insights and predictions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

- Implement a SARIMA model for analyzing time series data with seasonality.
- Explore the relationship between past values, errors, differenced series, and seasonal components in time-dependent datasets.
- Demonstrate skills in data visualization, time series decomposition, and model evaluation using Python.

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined the dataset for trends, seasonality, and irregular components.
- **Visualization:** Plotted time series data to understand its structure, variability, and seasonality over time.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and imputed missing data points to maintain the integrity of the time series.
- **Stationarity Check and Differencing:** Conducted stationarity tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and KPSS tests, and applied differencing to ensure the time series was suitable for SARIMA modeling.
- **Seasonal Differencing:** Performed seasonal differencing to handle seasonal patterns in the data.

### Model Implementation and Evaluation
- **SARIMA Model (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average):** Developed a SARIMA model to forecast future values based on past observations, differenced series, forecast errors, and seasonal components.
- **Model Diagnostics:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visual inspection of residual plots.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** The programming language used for data handling, analysis, and model implementation.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** Employed for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Utilized to create insightful visualizations of time series data.
- **statsmodels and pmdarima:** Used for implementing the SARIMA model and conducting statistical tests.

## Project Components

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyzed the time series data for trends, seasonal patterns, and irregular components.
- Created line plots, partial autocorrelation plots (PACF), and autocorrelation plots (ACF) to visualize the relationship between data points.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Stationarity Transformation:** Applied differencing techniques to stabilize the variance and make the series stationary.
- **Seasonal Differencing:** Handled seasonality by differencing the series at seasonal lags.
- **Feature Engineering:** Prepared lag variables to represent both past observations and forecast errors in the SARIMA model.

### Model Implementation
- **SARIMA Model Construction:** Implemented a SARIMA model to account for correlations in past values, differencing to handle non-stationarity, and seasonal components.
- **Prediction and Validation:** Generated forecasts and compared them against actual observations to assess accuracy.

### Model Evaluation and Interpretation
- Evaluated residuals for independence and normality.
- Analyzed the forecast horizon to understand the model's predictive limitations.
- **Residual Analysis:** Assessed the correlation and distribution of residuals to validate model assumptions.

## Example Output
After completing the analysis and modeling, the following outputs were generated:

- **Residual Plots:** Showed the adequacy of the SARIMA model in capturing the data's underlying structure and seasonality.
- **Forecast Results:** Predicted future values with accompanying confidence intervals.
- **Performance Metrics:** Reported metrics such as RMSE to quantify the model's predictive accuracy.

## Notes
This project demonstrates the practical application of the Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model for time series analysis. It highlights the importance of handling seasonality, data preprocessing, stationarity transformation, and model diagnostics in producing reliable forecasts.
